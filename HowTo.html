<h1>How to change your own oil</h1>
  
  <h2>What you need</h2>
  <p>A jack with jack stands or access to a lift<br>
     Wrench (size may very depending on your vehicle)<br>
     Oil filter wrench(size may very depending on your filter) or strap wrench<br>
     Oil specified in your owners manual<br>
     Oil filter<br>
     Oil catch can<br>
     Gloves<br>
     Rags<br>
     Eye protection<br>
     Once you have aquired all the required tools and supplies you will want position your jack under your car to lift it. I also like to wait until my car is not hot
     to avoid burning yourself from your exhaust pipe or the oil. Please follow the owners manual for your vehicles jacking points.
     Then you will place your jacks stands under the vehicle to give you room under your car. Make sure to use your jacks stands for safety purposes. Next you will locate your oil 
     tank drain valve, using your wrench you will remove this to let the oil drain completely out of your tank. After the oil has been completely drained out you can reinsert the valve.
     You will then remove the oil filter using the strap wrench or oil filter wrench. Replace the oil filter with the new one. Once your valve and filter are back in, I double check to make sure 
     everything is tightened down. Now that your vehicle has no oil it is time to add the new oil. You can lower your vehicle off the jack stands to have easier access to the filler neck.
     This is when you add your vehicle specific oil. Once you add your required amount put the cap back on and double check the dip stick for proper servicing. You have now officially changed your oil CONGRATS!<br>
