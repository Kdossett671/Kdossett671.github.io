<h1>My name is Kevin Dossett<br>Welcome to my Website</h1>

<div class="box">
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Kevin Dossett. I was born and raised in Southern California. I lived there most of my life until I joined the 
  military and started my career as a mechanic in the Air Force. I have travel all over the world and see many different places. 
  I have a few different hobbies and things I like to do in my spare time. I have noticed that as I get older the things I enjoy doing
  and my hobbies seem to get more and more expensive. Some of my hobbies are to travel, be in a car club, 
  paintball, play video games, collecting displates, and stream movies and TV shows.</p>
  </div>
<div class="box">
<p>The military has helped me travel all over the world and I hope to vist more places while I am still in. I was able to travel
  before enlisting thanks to a travel agent mother. However, there are still many places I would like to visit. Another big thing that takes up a lot 
  of my time is doing things with my car club.<br><picture><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kdossett671/Kdossett671.github.io/main/images/RTAlleyWay.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt""></picture><br>

  <p>I love working with my hands and even though I am a mechanic on airplanes I enjoying work on my car as 
  well as members in the car club. It is a never ending money pit but I love they way our cars look. I spend a lot of time browsing the internet
  for car parts. If you are ever in need of car parts or just want to see what some prices are you can check out there site here.

  I enjoy going out to the paintball field and playing speedball or even watching the pros play.<br><picture><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kdossett671/Kdossett671.github.io/main/images/paintball2%20.jpg" alt=""></picture><br>
